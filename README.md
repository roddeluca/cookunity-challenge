# CookUnity Challenge

This repository contains the implementation of the challenge sent by CookUnity. I decided to use Typescript and Express.js. For testing purposes I chose Jest.
The project is pretty simple, there are clients where I put the external calls and for the 2nd point, I chose to implement Redis which acts as a cache.


## Run the project

To run the project you should do:

``` bash
$ docker compose up
```

To run the tests you should do:

``` bash
$ npm run test
```


## To improve
Please raise a PR to add it with:
- More unit tests
- Implement feature tests (Cucumber potencial lib)
